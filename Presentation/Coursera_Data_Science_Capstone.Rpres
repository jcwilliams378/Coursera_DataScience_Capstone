Introduction
========================================================

- Presentation will highlight the approach and performance of a NLP application to predict text of short phrases 2-5 words in length.
- Application developed in Shiny which can be found at following URL:
  + https://jcwilliams378.shinyapps.io/NLP_coursera_capstone/
  + app uses alogrithm and presents histogram of the top words in addition to the top selected word
- Word predictions are scored based on the "Stupid Backoff" alogorithm and scoring method [1]

Data Assembly & Cleaning
========================================================

- Data is pulled from corpora of text data coming from raw news, blog, and twitter sources.
- Data is cleaned using the "tm" package in R implementing text filtering included a Profanity filter based on 723 words
- Final cleaned data is sent to csv files after creation of 2-5 n-grams 
  + CSVs are aggregated into SQLite database (sqldf R package) on which queries were performed to retrieve next possible word.
- Data was sampled into test and training data
  + test data was randomly pulled 2% of the blended copora
  + training data was pulled at 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%, and 1% of the blended corpora

Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# create a vector containing the training set pcts of the total raw data explored for model accuracy:
training_pcts <- c(0.01, 0.005, 0.003, 0.001)

# create data frame to concatonate all the separate files together
df <- data.frame()
for (train_pct in training_pcts){
    data_read <- read.csv(file = paste("~/Documents/Data Science Courses/Coursera/Data Science Specialization (JHU)/10 Capstone Project/final/en_US/accuracy results/accuracy_results_modeltrain_",train_pct,"pct.csv",sep = ""))

  if(train_pct == 0.01){
    df<-data_read
  }
  else{
      df <- merge(data_read, df, all = TRUE)
  }
}
df[,"unknown_word"] <- df$predicted_word == "No Word Predicted!"

df_summary <- df %>% 
  group_by(pct_data,ng) %>% 
  summarise(mean_process_time = mean(pred_time_ms),
            sd_process_time = sd(pred_time_ms),
            pct_correct_predicted = 100*mean(Result),
            pct_unknown = 100*mean(unknown_word))

limits <- aes(ymax = mean_process_time + sd_process_time, ymin=mean_process_time - sd_process_time)

ggplot(df_summary,aes(pct_correct_predicted,mean_process_time, label = 100*pct_data)) +
    geom_line(aes(colour = as.factor(ng))) +
    geom_errorbar(limits, width=0.2) + 
    geom_text(size=2, hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.25) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept=500) + 
    labs(title = "Process Time (ms) vs Model Accruacy, color = n-gram, label = % train", y="Average process time for prediction (ms)", x="Model Accuracy",colour = "n-gram")

Conclusion
========================================================

- We created a predictive tool capable of predicting the next word in a short phrase using the "stupid backoff" method for scoring and ordering the prediction. 
- Model accuracy vs performance speed was tested using different training set sizes and ultimate a training set of 0.3% of the total set was selected to achieve accuracies ranging from ranging from ~37-44% across n-grams ranging from 2-5 words with an expected prediction time of ~500 ms or less. The accuracy results reported are based on a test data set representing 2-5 n-gram phrases taken from a subset of 2% of the total blended data set provided where phrases occuring less than 4 times in frequency are dropped and the 'actual' expected result is defined as the highest frequency terminal word for the phrases recovered from the n-gram creation.
